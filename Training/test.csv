Creed - Illusion,"The sun rises to another day My constitution keeps changing 'Til it slips away So I lie awake and stare My mind thinking, just wandering Is anybody there? Should I stay or go Should I sleep or stay awake Am I really happy or is it all Just an illusion Sitting in my room now Hiding thoughts Just hoping one day I'll get out I hear a voice call my name Breaking trance, so silent So I can stay the same Should I stay or go Should I sleep or stay awake Am I really happy or is it all Just an illusion Wait now, many things left unsaid This life remains the same But I change I try to fool myself in believing Things are going to get better But life goes on Should I stay or go Should I sleep or stay awake Am I really happy or is it all Just an illusion",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Weird Al Yankovic - Albuquerque,"Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop You know the place well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast Awww - Big bowl of sauerkraut Every single mornin It wa driving me crazy I said to my mom I said  Hey, mom, what's with all the sauerkraut?  And my dear, sweet mother She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train And she leaned right down next to me And she said  IT'S GOOD FOR YOU  And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old That's when I swore that someday Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer And the towels are oh so fluffy Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel Wacka wacka doodoo yeah Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize That's right, a first class one-way ticket to Albuquerque Albuquerque Oh yeah You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before And I gotta tell ya, it was really great Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died Except for me You know why? 'Cause I had my tray table up And my seat back in the full upright position Had my tray table up And my seat back in the full upright position Had my tray table up And my seat back in the full upright position Ah ha ha ha Ah ha ha Ahhhh So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel But finally I arived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn Where the towels are oh so fluffy And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna It's OK, they're clean Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C And I turned on the SpectraVision And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door Well now, who could that be? I say  Who is it?  No answer  Who is it?  There's no answer  WHO IS IT?  They're not sayin' anything So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril Oh man, I hate it when I'm right So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel And I'm like  Hey, you can't have that   That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me  And he's like  Tough  And I'm like  Give it  And he's like  Make me  And I'm like  'Kay  So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation Yes indeed, you better believe it And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook And twenty seconds later, I heard a farmiliar voice And you know what it said? I'll tell you what it said It said  If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again   If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator   If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again   If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator  In Albuquerque Albuquerque Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice But first, I decided to buy some donuts So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter And he says  Yeah, what do ya want?  I said  You got any glazed donuts?  He said  No, we're outta glazed donuts  I said  Well, you got any jelly donuts?  He said  No, we're outta jelly donuts  I said  You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?  He said  No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts  I said  You got any cinnamon rolls?  He said  No, we're outta cinnamon rolls  I said  You got any apple fritters?  He said  No, we're outta apple fritters  I said  You got any bear claws?  He said  Wait a minute, I'll go check   No, we're outta bear claws  I said  Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?  He says  All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels  I said  OK, I'll take that  So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over (rabid gnawing sounds) Oh man, they were just going nuts They were tearin' me apart You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin' through my head  I believe it went a little something like this . . . Doh Get 'em off me Get 'em off me Oh No, get 'em off, get 'em off Oh, oh God, oh God Oh, get 'em off me Oh, oh God Ah, (more screaming) I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face Wavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin' Like a constipated weiner dog And as luck wouls have it, that's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams Her name was Zelda She was a caligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches I'll never forget the first thing she said to me. She said  Hey, you've got weasels on your face  That's when I knew it was true love We were inseperable after that Aw, we ate together, we bathed together We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss The world was our burrito So we got married and we bought us a house And had two beautiful children - Nathaniel and Superfly Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me She said  Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?  I said  Woah, hold on now, baby   I'm just not ready for that kinda commitment  So we broke up and I never saw her again But that's just the way things go In Albuquerque Albuquerque Anyway, things really started lookin' upi for me Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream That's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that I was gettin' a lot of attitude OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot Tryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil When I see this guy Marty tryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself So I, I say to him, I say  Hey, you want me to help you with that?  And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes  No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw  So I did And then he gets all indignant on me He's like  Hey man, I was just being sarcastic  Well, that's just great How was I supposed to know that? I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname - Torso-Boy So what's he complaining about? Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn't had a bit in three days Well, I knew what he meant But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein And he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over And I'm like  Hey, come on, don'tcha get it?  But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming (screaming sounds) You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation Man, some people just can't take a joke, you know? Anyway, um, um, where was I? Kinda lost my train of thought Uh, well, uh, OK Anyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it But I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is I hate sauerkraut That's all I'm really tryin' to say And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up And find yourself in an existential quandry Full of loathing and self-doubt And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours There's still a little place called Albuquerque Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque I said  A  (A)  L  (L)  B  (B)  U  (U)  querque  (querque) Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque Albuquerque",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Millencolin - Greener Grass,I'm not harmonic I can't reach self-esteem That's quite ironic Coz I thought I'd be living my dream I don't feel supersonic I don't drive in the lane of whipped cream I'm more like a chronic Ignorantly swimming upstream What can I do to be happy? I have problems to decide When it looks to me the grass is greener On the other side How do I live for the moment When I always wanna be else where? How do I reach fullfilment When I'm crashed and got parts to repair? Why is my only amusement Giving other people my despair? Why do I give jealous judgement On another's affair? I wanna get satisfaction just like The Stones and Manu Chao Gotta ignore all rejection I gotta keep trying anyhow I wanna be close to the action I wann live my life now For htis correction I need direction Gotta find it within myself somehow So maybe one day I'll be happy?! But until then I have to realize That the grass is not always greener It's only up to me to recognize That the grass is not always greener It's in your head it might look grenner Coz the grass will never be greener On the other side,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bad Religion - Automatic Man,"He's the latest superhero with powers so profound. He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound. I know you must have seen him in books and magazines. He's the quintessential mindless modern epicine. His life is meaningful because he gets things done. Bang bang he's dead, chalk up another triumph for our hero, The Automatic Man. It's true you must have met him, he's your best friend and your foe. His opinions are determined by the status quo. A true creature of habit, he smokes three packs a day. When he has an original thought, he forgets it right away. He's a paradigm of carefree living. He's our mentor, disturb him if you can. He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking. He's our savior, he is the common man. So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind, Then take a careful look around and brother you will find...

Boy Hits Car - Im A Cloud,"And you will heal yourself when the rain begins to fall. Feel the fire Burning inside us all. Remove me For going in unchained. Blow away for yourself and gather again. And, listen to the conversations of the sea. Inside us all There's a quiet beach. If we fall into ourselves we will become free. I myself could use a little clarity. I am so full of love. I am so full of hate. I am so full of these feelings That turn me every which way. I am so full of you. I am so full of me. I am so full of these words That don't tell her a fucking thing. I am so full of love. I am so full of hate. I am so full of these feelings That turn me every which way. Then I opened up my mouth. I'm a cloud. And these words they seldom come out. When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why She'd want a cloud that's *fucking around.* But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear. And feel the fury of these tears As they run down my face I can feel her so far away. 'Cause I am a cloud. And I am so afraid. I am so full of love. I am so full of hate. I am so full of these feelings That turn me every which way. So don't you come and gather at me in this haze. I sit at home and feel the sun's daze. *I should tell me not to little everyday.* I blow away remaining unfazed. When I feel the there's something crawling out of me I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise. These motherfuckers stepped on me, Tried to fuck me from behind. 'Cause I am a cloud. And I am so afraid. And I... I am. So... full of love. I am so full of love. I am so full of hate. I am so full of these feelings That turn me every which way. I am so full of you. I am so full of me. I am so full of these words That don't tell her a fucking thing. I am so full of love. I am so full of hate. I am so full of these feelings That turn me every which way. I am... so full of love.

Boy Hits Car - Man Without Skin,"Can you see the line where the water ends? Throws itself off into oblivion. As sky goes so complacent And then spits a little compassion. Dusk approaches, the city's carnivorous. *Moisture's* sweat like it once would eat us And devour everything but this mouth Sings of this glorious fetus. Tucked deep inside the rafts of blood. Everywhere it seemed that there's a memory. Sometimes memories kill me. As I travel the avenues of the streets And shadow deli's of this fucking city. Everyday day it seem to love a little less. Seem to love to chew on my calmness. And drive me to the end of myself Where he is. Dispose of me. You're like a man without skin. Everything he touches seems to hurt him . And he says maybe I'm just a person. But I'll be for you if you let me. All I want is animals to be free. Run around and fuck right out in the street. Every day they're gonna wanna eat me. But I'll try not to take it personally. And is there no love in this city? Can someone have just a little pity? You're like a man without skin. Everything that touches seems to hurt him. And he says maybe I'm just a person. But I'll be for you if you let me Just like a man without skin Everything he sees seems to touch him And he says that the one who watches over me I'll stand alone let god make a trade. Come on, baby. Penetrate me. You go so deep, So deep in me. Is there no love in this city? Could someone have just a little pity? 'Cause we're tucked deep inside the rafts of blood You're like a man without skin. Everything that touches seems to hurt him. And he says maybe I'm just a person. But I'll be for you if you let me. Just like a man without skin, Everything he sees seems to touch him. And he says that the one who watches over me. I'll stand alone let god make a trade. Penetrate me. Penetrate me. Can you see the line where the water ends? Throws itself off into oblivion.

More and more its an animal, Waiting to be seen, Face of someone's failures, I seek society in need, indeed, indeed. (?) Indeed. Spoken In the beginning it seems that a known face beyond having fun, Which is why you write music in the first place, Always moving, defining, and pushing forward the art that once created, Looking to the right time to share it, And then the headaches of criticism, Senior advisors advising people above, Twisting, distorting that which we love, And never ending problems with money, Holding you back, Preventing progress, I thought you only started 'cause it was fun. We play the blaming game, Yes I mind, Its not your turn. We play the blaming game, Yes I mind, Its not your turn. We play the blaming game, Yes I mind, Its not your turn!

Judas Priest - Screaming for Vengeance,"Hey listen don't you let them get your mind Fill your brain with orders and that's not right. They're playing at a game that draws you closer Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear. Always takin' baby out that's o.k. What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me. Told you one you're never gonna win the race Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face. We are screaming, screaming for vengeance The world is a manacled place. Screaming, screaming for vengeance The world is defiled in disgrace. Tie a blindfold all around your head Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread. And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner Then they lead you out into the final slaughter. As the sweat is runnin' down your neck All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up. Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode Got to fight the horror of this mental load. So you wait it out and bide your time Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line. Everyone who wins in the great escape Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake. I don't talk about it but that's alright Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight. If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Time's racing like the wind, Execution's near, Oh lord, I wait for death, And, yes, I have no fear. I recall that night, my every breath, And, step along the way. Closed my eyes, walking, As danger paved the way. The devil, and the darkness Let her evil wander free And, here on Devils Island, The final stop for me. Chorus: Devils Island, Devils Island. Oh, there is no escape, The sea is full of sharks. The tide takes you away, and Smashes you on the rocks. The sun is shining, But feel not today, It's warmth, it's dying, And fading away. Chorus (repeat): Devils Island, here I stay,' Devils Island. Oh, hear the call, From the grave beyond. Oh, so pernicious, Her soul it creates song. As there is no man, that is Here upon the earth, Able to terminate our Noisome will since birth. The priest that reads the sermons, Is walking next to me, To the stake, my last request, To have her burn with me. But, so it did, the heavens opened, Rain began to fall. The final judgement came, and Was spread before you all. Final judgement. Old, weak, and feeble, But the lesson taught to me, To stay away from evil, She doesn't care for me. She haunts me in my sleep, Though I tore that page away. And, here on Devils Island, I'll always have to stay. Chorus (repeat): Devils Island, Devils Island. Devils Island, Devils Island. Here I am.

A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies. A little man with a big eraser, changing history Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees. Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue. Make a person disappear, and no one will ever miss you. Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was. Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws. Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules. Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools. You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway? Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way? Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come. I believe my kingdom will come. Chorus: F is for fighting, R is for red, Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed. E, we elect them, E, we eject them, In the land of the free, and the home of the brave. D, for your dying, O, your overture, M, they will cover your grave with manure. This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me, As long as there's a P.M.R.C.

Hatred and guilt the alter they've built high priests of sin, Destiny Fate the wicked ones gate beckoning you in. Down the walkways through the blood stained town, Looking down the cross bleeding from the crown. Led to stay to die beside the thieves, Kill the king of the world to be. And now to you this will come a putrifying pestilance, More noxious then the serpent's breath malevontley destined, More corrupt then the malice of Choronzon, More disease then the wind of the moonlight sun. Putrifaction you have caused no need for confession, Now you wish you had a God to stop your demolition. Crushing the bones of the hundred folds, Swinging the judgement hammer. Man Woman Child no one is safe, The heads of the dead are the banner. And this was all you got so don these broken wings, Sands of time run out bells of Hades ring. Is this a nightmare to unhallow thy name, Smell of brimstone dancing in the flames. No help now as you fulfill his task, Chief of evil has got you by the ass. Set free to sit upon the throne, Just a dream you're weeping all alone.

Megadeth - My Last Words,"My life's on time, But again my sense is late. Feel a might unsteady, But still I have to play. Six to one's the odds, And, we have the highest stakes. And, once again I gamble with my very life today. Highly polished metal, The oil makes it gleam. Fill the terror chamber, Your mind begins to scream. Your life is like a trigger, Never trouble till you're squeezed. Now you crack a smile, As you give the gun a tease. Place the piston down, Now give the gun a spin. Soon as the spinning stops, Oh no, the game starts in. A hateful way of vengeance, A bit of playful sin. Load another bullet, Now the second round begins. A couple grains of powder, A couple grams of lead. A touch against the trigger, A touch inside the head. Take another drink, and Raise the last bets. Think about my last words, They might be what I just said. A click comes from the hammer, That couldn't drive a nail. Sense the numbing cold blue, Or the red of Hades' grill. A fraction of a second, Do you lose, or maybe still, Pass it to the left, And collect your mighty kill. Add another bullet, The third round begins. Soon as the spinning stops, Oh no, the game starts in. Please, no I.O.U.'s, No markers for death. Does anybody play? Anybody, Somebody, anybody play. You, you, next victim, you next to die.

Mudvayne - Cradle,"Breathe... Push... ...I lost you, you were my god thought what do I do now you were never there for me never there to carry me, 26 years looking back that time is gone it was you I believed in look what you've done to me realize what you've done to Me I can't see going on in this darkness I'm blind beneath my cradle the bough has broke, I exorcise my loss your lie the punishment It takes time to try to mend the wounds of all the suffering, What do I do now all I'm asking from you please send me a sign to guide me through the times that lie in front of me I'll get by myself Look at me now, a piece of shit like you. Look at me now, you left me so fuck you. Everybody leaves me, everybody's gone. Watch my father leave me, there's nobody left. Feels like I've never been loved. Everybody leaves me, never gave a shit about me. Everybody's gone, I'll rot in my head alone. I don't give a fuck about you, go the fuck away . Fake being, inside of my heart you are the liar. Innocence displaced. Been left. Here I stand now and I'm alone, With no one to comfort me. One set of footprints in the sand. No one to take my hand, I'll . I'll walk through as long as I need. I'll drift through my life though I'm alone. Outgrown the cradle that once housed me And I've found that all I need is Me. Found I've never needed you to push through All the shit that stacks up inside of my life. Endless plight that circulates through my body. I'll keep stumbling, beating, pummeling Teething on the rind and renounce my being. I can't see going on. I can't see I'm so tired, of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering. What do I do now? All I'm asking from you please, Send me a sign To guide me through the times that lie in front of me. I'll get by myself I can't see going on fuck it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mudvayne - Nothing To Gein,"Cold and silent, soiled face I will wash it all away, With my love, That's all she's ever needed, from me It's my time, to mother, One of my own in my life, I am so alone, left with no one In my life, I'm so alone Life submissiveness, Hypnotizing the ignorant a little boy's best friend's always his mother, At least that's what she said, Life of a simple man, Taught that everyone else is dirty, And their love is meaningless, I'm just a soiled dirty boy, I'm just a soiled dirty boy, Sheltered life innocence, Insulated memories, spark reflections of my head, Duality in my consciousness, Caught in the war of hemispheres, Between the love lost in my head, Mommy do you still live inside of me, I'm so lost in my life without any guiding, Protected me my whole life from everything, Nailed shut the doors to the shrine, To screen your dead eyes from me and my sickness, Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading, Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face, Deliver the remains from her womb of earth, Prep the rack and tie up for new love's rebirth, Covert understanding of novice surgery, I'll focus concentration and only take just what I need For sickness I'm masticating, Dancing and masturbating, Celebrate in fields of night with skin upon my face If I soak my hands in others blood am I sick, If I wash my hands in others blood am I sick, If I drench myself in others blood am I sick, If I bathe myself in others blood Blame mother for the sickness, Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading, Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face, Dance and masturbate in night light by myself.. Nothing is left for me to gain they're coming to take me far away, Chorus Life of a simple man taught that everyone else is dirty and love is meaningless I'm so soiled Soiled",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

You're friendless. It's endless. Your flower has soured. It's endless. You're friendless. It's harder. And stronger. But no one's been inside you longer. Or harder. Or deeper. To get you off, you need the fear. It's never love. Bloody touch. Broken wrist. Needle rust. Choking throat. Swallowed teeth. Head fuck. No peace. I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me. You've got to love me. Ornament. Shrunken head. Playtoy. Snake strike. Poisonous. Syphillis. Drenched me. Soaked me. I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me. You've got to hate me.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

For the mob, truly, does rule at this particular time. We've grown into a monster. An arrogant, explosive motherfuck. Hard as a rock. Shut like a lock. Finally, the president in submission. He holds out his hand on Your television and draws back a stump. It's too late for some. Far too late. No more holdbacks. No more paying a cops paycheck. Let him Bust his own child. The son that heeds my word and smokes my dope. The daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything. Hail Kings. The new Kings. Stronger than all. A simple process to legalize.

Sentenced - Awaiting the Winter Frost,"A gathering in the cold, in the North, in the dark lands of Pohjola Where the sun had not been crossing the sky nor seen for centuries... We were brought together by oaths we had once sworn - by blood... ...once together drawn... We had gathered all our forces Called together all the heroes Equipped a hundred swordmen And a thousand men with crossbows Strengthened by hate and the thirst for the enemies' blood We lay in wait for the season of no light We had seen the frozen mist - we weren't afraid to die And the oath we had sworn gave us reason to live on A Calm before the Storm (We were) Awaiting the Winter Frost ...And then a storm arose in fury The sky was shattered by lightning... Awaiting the Winter Frost As the sky blackened and the stars turned red The frost greeted us with a cold northern breeze Off with their heads! Off with their fuckin' heads!!! Oh, the time had come... To slaughter the hordes of cowardice And cleanse the North from lies We had gathered all our forces Called together all the heroes Equipped a hundred swordmen And a thousand men with crossbows We raised our swords Grasped the irons Lifted our bows And chose the arrows The false ones' hordes were put to the sword The strong and the weak, one by one... Their race was slaughtered to the very last man Our bloodfeind was done as their bodies reddened the land Awaiting the Winter Frost The sign of the dark and the cold the spell of pure hate Awaiting the Winter Frost And the heathen peace was found",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Testament - Alone in the Dark,"Alone in the Dark Lyrics: When I was but very young Sorcerers came to claim my mind Leaving death and hatred to unmask The master of the game had won And let his final sin be known Killing those who stand in his path Alone in the dark, where the demons are torturing me The dark passage of revenge is all that I see Armies of witches are called in from the north Murder of the elders occur The high priest of evil has lowered his iron fist Thousands of people have died The slaughter of the innocent The house is burning that lights the sky My nightmare has begun to unfold The hissing of the cobra�s tongue Sound and feel of ripping flesh Fall two thousand feet sky My terror has controlled my life And let my only weakness known I got to rid this hell from my head I fight off evil sorcerers Rid my mind of his torture And meet the falling angel in his realm Alone in the dark, where the demons are torturing me The dark passage of revenge is all that I see Faustus prepares the legions of the night Diviners from the far north arrive Aimlessly people there huddled in a pack Wreaking deadly havoc on mankind I fall in my deepest sleep To meet the evil asteroth His title is the grand duke of hell I fight until the end is near To rid my mind of hopes and fears My destination lies in my dreams Set me free ! When I was but very young Sorcerers came to claim my mind Leaving death and hatred to unmask The master of the game had won And let his final sin be known Killing those who stand in his path Alone in the dark, where the demons are torturing me The dark passage of revenge is all that I see Armies of witches are called in from the north Murder of the elders occur The high priest of evil has lowered his iron fist Thousands of people will die",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wicked is as wicked does he'll fight it till the end he'll show his finger than say: I'm a wicked one. He's a stereotype bastard and he likes it that way.

They say get off the stage they say get outta here. Can't be all that punkrock can't be all that queer. He'll make them wish they never knew him he'll make them pay for being wrong.

Thursday - I Am The Killer,Tuesday wakes up silent And there aren't enough pills to sleep And then it cuts out like miswired shortwave radio It's over But nothing can change to ever make it right When you live in a nightmare It's written all over your face. And in a short time You're never the same again The distance is streamlined Between decision and defense: Distorient the senses Loss of identity No one to trust Life runs through this trade I am no killer But I still hide my face In the coming days I wake up every morning From the same dream And then I kill it But you can't change the letters when the ink dries I woke up on the sidewalk and everything just changed Now the lights are blinking but I can't see anything Everything is falling apart: Crumpled paper Crushed tin cans Broken bottles Paper scraps We all look the same We all look the same But I am the killer,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tonic - Mean To Me,There's an empty place inside that is hurting me A place that keeps my heart out on its own A disconnected function of my wretchedness That keeps me so hard pressed It's a place where words are spoken you will never hear A broken bridge of lines that just won't come An empty lung that won't give the wind to speak at me How far can it be from home Why you gotta be so mean to me Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need So why you gotta be so mean to me Do you think that it got up and left for good this time A crowd of faceless strangers moving on A feeling that you left it all behind you now That it doesn't hurt somehow To know CHORUS So open up the book that you keep deep inside Let the pages yellow in the sun Show them that you're not afraid to let them see How far you can be From home Why you gotta be so mean to me Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need So why you gotta be so fucking mean to me Why you gotta be Why you gotta be Why you gotta be Why you gotta be Why you gotta be Why you gotta be Why you gotta be so mean to me Thanks to musicsuperstar@hotmail.com for these lyrics,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tool - Disgustipated,"And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber. And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possesed me then. And I begged,  Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?  And the angel said unto me,  These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots! You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust.  And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,  Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!  Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus. Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on........ This is necessary. It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then. That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this. You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.  If God is our Father,  you thought,  then Satan must be our cousin.   Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely. Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points As I'm all by myself tonight not again not againE And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely. Well if you should nervously break down When its time for the shakedown would you take it It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice.

Pink Floyd - Dogs,"You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking. And after a while, you can work on points for style Like the club tie, and the firm handshake A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to So that when they turn their backs on you You'll get the chance to put the knife in. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older And in the end you'll pack up, fly down south Hide your head in the sand Just another sad old man All alone and dying of cancer. And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've sown And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around So have a good drown, as you go down, alone Dragged down by the stone. I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze? Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner And everythings done under the sun And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer. Who was born in a house full of pain Who was trained not to spit in the fan Who was told what to do by the man Who was broken by trained personnel Who was fitted with collar and chain Who was given a pat on the back Who was breaking away from the pack Who was only a stranger at home Who was ground down in the end Who was found dead on the phone Who was dragged down by the stone.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Red Hot Chili Peppers - Green Heaven,"About this planet, there is something I know There's a very big difference between above and below A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow Here, above land, man has laid his plan And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan We got a government so twisted and bent Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution And that's a heart felt shame 'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame? Time now to take you to a different place Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none 'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun No one tells 'em how their life is run And no one points at them with a gun They have a lot of love for every living creature The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you Back to the land of the police man Where he does whatever he says he can Including hating you because you're a Jew Or beating black ass, that's nothing new Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail So support your police, support your local wars That's the way to open economic doors Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore We assume the position to sell the ammunition What the fuck?

Look at the signs, look at the way they stop and stare. they're watching you die, and when you're gone it's like you weren't even there. Cause you're a famous monster, you do whatever they offer.

Stone Sour - Omega,"What a skeletal wreck of man this is. Translucent flesh and feeble bones, the kind of temple where the whores and villains try to tempt the holistic domes. Running rampid with free thought to free form, and the free and clear. When the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a laundry mat to sift and focus on the bigger, better, now. We all have a little sin that needs venting, virtues for the rending and laws and systems and stems are ripped from the branches of office, do you know where your post entails? Do you serve a purpose, or purposely serve? When in doubt inside your atavistic allure, the value of a summer spent, and a winter earned. For the rest of us, there is always Sunday. The day of the week the reeks of rest, but all we do is catch our breath, so we can wade naked in the bloody pool, and place our hand on the big, black book. To watch the knives zigzag between our aching fingers. A vacation is a countdown, T minus your life and counting, time to drag your tongue across the sugar cube, and hope you get a taste. WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS FOR? WHAT THE HELL�S GOING ON? SHUT UP! I can go on and on but lets move on, shall we? Say, your me, and I�m you, and they all watch the things we do, and like a smack of spite they threw me down the stairs, haven�t felt like this in years. The great magnet of malicious magnanimous refuse, let me go, and punch me into the dead spout again. That�s where you go when there�s no one else around, it�s just you, and there was never anyone to begin with, now was there? Sanctimonious pretentious dastardly bastards with their thumb on the pulse, and a finger on the trigger. CLASSIFIED MY ASS! THAT�S A FUCKING SECRET, AND YOU KNOW IT! Government is another way to say better�than�you. It�s like ice but no pick, a murder charge that won�t stick, it�s like a whole other world where you can smell the food, but you can�t touch the silverware. Huh, what luck. Fascism you can vote for. Humph, isn�t that sweet? And we�re all gonna die some day, because that�s the American way, and I�ve drunk too much, and said too little, when your gaffer taped in the middle, say a prayer, say a face, get your self together and see what�s happening. SHUT UP! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! I�m sorry, I could go on and on but their times to move on so, remember: you�re a wreck, an accident. Forget the freak, your just nature. Keep the gun oiled, and the temple cleaned shit snort, and blaspheme, let the heads cool, and the engine run. Because in the end, everything we do, is just everything we�ve done.",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion Move on Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing Move on Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning Move on How I treasure every minute Being part of it, being in it With the urge to move on I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time And somewhere lies the answer To all the questions why What really makes the difference Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la) Life is motion (la la la la la la-la) Move on (la la la la-la) Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la) Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la) Move on (la la la la-la) Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la) Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la) Move on (la la la la-la) How I treasure every minute (la la la la) Being part of it (la la la la) Being in it (la la la la) With the urge to move on The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea The crying of the seagulls that hover over me I see it and I hear it But how can I explain The wonder of the moment To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la) Life is motion (la la la la la la-la) Move on (la la la la-la) Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la) Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la) Move on (la la la la-la) Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la) Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la) Move on (la la la la-la) How I treasure every minute (la la la la) Being part of it (la la la la-ah) Being in it With the urge to move on La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la Like a wind that's always blowing La la la la la la-la La la la la la la-la (life is flowing) La la la la-la (move on) Like the sunrise in the morning La la la la la la-la La la la la la la-la (life is dawning) La la la la-la (move on) How I treasure every minute (la la la la) Being part of it (la la la la-ah) Being in it With the urge to move on La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la Like a wind that's always blowing... fade",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ash - Girl From Mars,"Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars? I don't know if you knew that. Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman Cigars. Though she never told me her name, I still love you, Girl From Mars. Sitting in our dreamy days by the water's edge, On a cool summer's night. Fireflies and the stars in the sky, Gentle glowing light, From your cigarette. The breeze blowing softly on my face, Reminds me of something else. Something that in my memory has been replaced, Suddenly it all comes back. And as I look to the stars. I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars, I don't know if you knew that. Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman Cigars. Though she never told me her name, I still love you, Girl From Mars. Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand, Electricity in the air. Twisting all through the night on the terrace, Now that summer's here. I know you are almost in love with me, I can see it in your eyes. Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight, And it almost blows my mind And as I look to the stars I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars, I don't know if you knew that. Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman Cigars. Though she never told me her name, I still love you, Girl From Mars. Today I sleep in the chair by the window, It felt as if you'd returned. I thought that you were standing over me, When I woke there was no-one there. I still love you, Girl From.. Mars Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars? I don't know if you knew that. Oh we'd stay up late playing cards, Henri Winterman Cigars. Though she never told me her name.

I'm knowing that right now is all that matters. All the nights we stayed up talking and listening to 80's songs; quoting lines from all those movies that we love. It still brings a smile to my face. I guess when it comes down to it... Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart and eventually you'll finally get it right. Breaking into hotel swimming pools, and wreaking havoc on our world. Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time. The black top's singing me to sleep. Lighting fireworks in parking lots, illuminate the blackest nights. Cherry cokes under this moonlight summer sky. 2015 Riverside, it's time to say,  goodbye.  Get on the bus, it's time to go. Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives.

High above someone is calling to me: Life is for living and living is free. You to me are like the sun in the sky See how you fly you have wings of your own. You and me our love will last without end Ride with the wind won't you follow me home. Turn around and see the circles we spin And we're taking our chances on where we begin. Up above the rain is falling on me Life is for living and living is free. You to me are like the sun in the sky See how you fly you have wings of your own You and me our love will last without end Ride with the wind won't you follow me home. Taking up time trying to write a line till the break of day. Given a sign can you make it rhyme tell me what to say. Making it fine can you ease my mind help me drift away. Turn around and see the circles we spin Taking our chances on where we begin. Up above the rain is falling on me Life is for living and living is free.

Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve I have a history of taking off my shirt It�s been one week since you looked at me Threw your arms in the air and said you�re crazy Five days since you tackled me I�ve still got the rug burns on both my knees It�s been three days since the afternoon You realized it�s not my fault not a moment too soon Yesterday you�d forgiven me And now I sit back and wait till you say you�re sorry Chickity china the chinese chicken You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin� Watchin x-files with no lights on, we�re dans la maison I hope the smoking man�s in this one Like harrison ford I�m getting frantic Like sting I�m tantric Like snickers, guaranteed to satisfy Like kurasawa I make mad films Okay I don�t make films But if I did they�d have a samurai Gonna get a set of better clubs Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs just so my Irons aren�t always flying off the back-swing Gotta get in tune with sailor moon Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes That make me think the wrong thing How can I help it if I think you�re funny when you�re mad Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad I�m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral Can�t understand what I mean? you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve I have a history of losing my shirt It�s been one week since you looked at me Dropped your arms to your sides and said I�m sorry Five days since I laughed at you And said you just did just what I thought you were gonna do Three days since the living room We realized we�re both to blame, but what could we do? Yesterday you just smiled at me Cause it�ll still be two days till we say we�re sorry It�ll still be two days till we say we�re sorry It�ll still be two days till we say we�re sorry Birchmount stadium, home of the robbie",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Repeat chorus At the copa... she lost her love Her name is lola, she was a showgirl, But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show Now it�s a disco, but not for lola, Still in dress she used to wear, Faded feathers in her hair She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind She lost her youth and she lost her tony Now she�s lost her mind Repeat chorus At the copa... don�t fall in love Don�t fall in love",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
